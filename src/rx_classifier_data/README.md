# Description

Here is where the configuration files used to train MVA classifiers for the RX analysis are placed

- **v1**: Version using only cut based HLT lines, presented in September 2024
- **v2**: Version trained with rare modes, both MVA turbo and sprucing lines
- **v2px**: Each of these versions trains the partially reconstructed MVA with a different cone size, represented by `x`.
